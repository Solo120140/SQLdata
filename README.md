# SQLMiner
Miner for Bitcoin implemented in SQL

Standard Miner for Bitcoin(sha256d algorithm) and Litecoin(scrypt algorithm) converted to make the "work" in SQL.
Why? Because you can execute the queries gratis on Google BigQuery and have a miner that run potentially with 0 costs.
I reached 2 Ghash with this implementation. Fork, improve it and most of all have fun with the crypto things ;)
